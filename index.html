            <h2 class="header-influence">Influence of The Beatles</h2>
            <div>The Beatles spearheaded the "British Invasion" of rock bands from the United Kingdom becoming popular in the United States in the 1960s. Their iconic look, catchy tunes, and rebellious experimentation with sound and style made them immensely influential with both music fans and musicians alike.

                Their studio innovations - including using the recording studio as an instrument itself to create new sounds - revolutionized rock music production. Concept albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are considered artistic masterpieces that expanded the possibilities of popular music. The Beatles' immense popularity helped globalize the entertainment industry and spark new interests in Eastern spirituality, psychedelic drugs, avant-garde art, and more. Their films like A Hard Day's Night helped define the music video format.

                After breaking up in 1970, the former members each had successful solo careers maintaining the group's lasting relevance. The Beatles set artistic and commercial standards for rock bands that are still emulated today across all genres of popular music.
